After extensive debugging, the issue was resolved by updating the Node.js version and npm.  Previously, the project was running on an older, unsupported Node.js version.  Updating to the latest LTS version resolved the incompatibility issues with Expo CLI and allowed the Metro Bundler to start correctly. 

Here's how the solution was implemented:

1. **Update Node.js:**  The Node.js version was updated to a supported LTS version (e.g., v16 or v18). Instructions for updating Node.js can be found on the official Node.js website based on your operating system.
2. **Update npm:** After updating Node.js, npm was also updated using `npm install -g npm@latest`. This ensured all dependencies were aligned with the new Node.js version.
3. **Clear Cache (Optional):** Although not directly related to the solution, clearing the Expo and npm cache is always recommended after such updates: `expo prebuild --clean` and `npm cache clean --force`.
4. **Restart:** The Expo CLI was restarted by closing and reopening the terminal window. 
5. **Run `expo start`:**  The command `expo start` was executed again, and the development server launched successfully.
